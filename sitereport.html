   <b6 class="b6"> Learning to code in HTML and CSS for the first time was a challenging yet fulfilling experience for me.
     As someone who had little to no experience in coding, I found myself excited by the prospect of creating
      a website from scratch.

    I began by learning the basic syntax of HTML and CSS, and gradually started designing my first website.
     However, designing the site was not without its challenges. There were moments where I felt frustrated 
     with how my site looked or functioned, but I persisted and used these challenges as learning opportunities.
    
    One particular challenge that stood out was when I had trouble with my site's layout. I spent hours trying 
    to troubleshoot the issue, but couldn't find what was causing the problem. It was only after I tried to 
    isolate the problematic elements that I discovered a typo in my CSS code, which was preventing my site
     from displaying correctly. This was a valuable lesson for me, as it taught me to be more meticulous
      in my coding and to pay close attention to detail. I used the help of online colour schemes to help design
      the colours id use on the page. i seeked help on youtube in helping make the typing effect on the 
      index page. learning the fuctionality of css really made my page flourish as i was able to change 
      the layout as i chose to
    
    Despite the ups and downs, I felt a sense of satisfaction every time I overcame an obstacle and saw my website
     coming to life. As I progressed, I discovered that designing a website with HTML and CSS was not only about 
     creating a visually appealing website but also about ensuring its functionality.
    
    In addition, I also discovered that having a clear understanding of HTML and CSS concepts was crucial for 
    creating a website that is accessible and user-friendly. It was important for me to consider factors such 
    as user friendliness and readability when designing my site, which further solidified my understanding 
    of HTML and CSS.</b6>
